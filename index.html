            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revert files back to a previous version, revert the entire project back to a previous version, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you make a mistake or lose files, you can easily recover from any problems. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.  As a graphic or web designer, a VCS will let you keep every version of an image or layout.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory. This approach is very common because it is so simple especially for a single user, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.</p>
            <p class="lead">To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.</p>
            <p class="lead">One of the more popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many computers today. Even the popular Mac OS X operating system includes the rcs command when you install the Developer Tools. RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.</p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #3
                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Developers need to collaborate. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems, such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce, have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.</p>
            <p class="lead">Developers know to some level what everyone else on the project is doing and administrators have detailed control over who can do what.  It’s easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.  However, the most obvious downsize is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents. </p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/distributed.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #4
                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs have their clients not just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository. So if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.</p>
            <p class="lead">Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren’t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.</p>

        <!-- Fifth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic5">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="https://superdevresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/GIT-logo_300x300.jpg">

                <span class="text-muted">Topic 5 Header</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.</p>
            <p class="lead">Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.</p>
